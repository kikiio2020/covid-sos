<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’ve created this site as an experiment to help folks who are in self-quarantine either because they have or suspected to have the virus or they are one of the at risk demographic, and need help getting essentials. This tool can help neighbourhoods to help one another to get what they need.</p> 
<p>Even if they are not self-quarantine, this tool may help individuals or groups to take turn to go to shops so to minimize exposures outside until this difficult time has past us.</p>
<p>This tool is not intended to make money for another. Helpers should not be helping for monetary gain, and I the site creator shall not benefit monetarily from any usage, and data shall not be sold for personal profits. Instead participants in this experiment should view your involvement as reciprocal, as anyone could be contracted, or pass on to our loved ones.</p> 
<p>As this is an experiment, you are using this tool at your own risk. I welcome your feedbacks and will try my best address your concerns to make this work for everyone, though I must ask for your forgiveness if it doesn’t work for every single individuals.</p>
<p>Thank you and good luck to us all!</p>
<p>Daniel 'Kikiio' Leung</p>
